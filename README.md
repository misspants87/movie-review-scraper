# movie-review-scraper

## Description
This app allows a client to enter a movie title, which then opens a headless browser using Puppeteer and crawls the subreddit r/moviecritic and scrapes all movie reviews written by users for that movie. It then analyzes the reviews using Natural, a natural language processor, to obtain a score, representing how favorably the movie was reviewed overall. It then returns this score to the client.
